Here are the features used in the Advanced Encryption Tool:
Encryption Techniques
Caesar Cipher: Shifts alphabets by a specified number.
Vigenère Cipher: Uses a keyword to shift alphabets.
Reverse Cipher: Reverses the input string.
XOR Cipher: Performs bitwise XOR operation.
AES Encryption: Utilizes Advanced Encryption Standard with various modes (CBC, ECB, CFB).
Hashing Algorithms
SHA-256: Secure Hash Algorithm for data integrity verification.
MD5: Message-Digest Algorithm for data integrity verification.
Digital Signatures
RSA Key Pair Generation: Creates private and public RSA keys.
RSA Signing: Signs messages using private RSA keys.
RSA Verification: Verifies signatures using public RSA keys.
Key Exchange Protocols
Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange: Securely exchanges keys between parties.
Secure Password Storage
Bcrypt Hashing: Password hashing using Bcrypt algorithm.
Argon2 Hashing: Password hashing using Argon2 algorithm.
Two-Factor Authentication
TOTP (Time-Based One-Time Password): Generates and verifies TOTP tokens.
Steganography
Image Steganography: Hides encrypted messages within images.
Randomization
Randomized Encryption Keys: Generates random encryption keys.
Randomized Initialization Vectors: Generates random IVs for AES encryption.
Additional Features
File Encryption: Encrypts and decrypts files.
Base64 Encoding: Encodes binary data for secure transmission.
Secure Key Generation: Generates secure keys for encryption.

Secure data encryption and decryption utility.
